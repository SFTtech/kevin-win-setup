# Stage 3 - Packaging

# TODO Packaging has still some problems with Qt
# We're on it, this file is just a placeholder

# Open a command prompt at <openage directory>\build (or use the one from the building step):

# TODO Use Qtdeploy.ps1 for packaging
# <vcpkg-directory>\ports\qt5-base\qtdeploy.ps1

# cpack -C RelWithDebInfo -V
#The installer (openage-<version>-win32.exe) will be generated in the same directory.
